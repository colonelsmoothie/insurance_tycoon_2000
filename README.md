Insurance industry management simulator

You are the CEO of an insurance company. The goals of the game are to:

- maximize profits
- maximize market share
- minimize liabilities
- crush your competitors

In other words, your goal is to try to create the most profitable company you can (and thus maximize earnings for yourself). Standing in your way are competitors, consumer advocacy groups, and regulators. You may choose to operate within the confines of the law or beyond it, while taking full responsibility for your actions should you get caught!
