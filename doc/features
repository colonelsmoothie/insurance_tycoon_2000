Regulatory
- bribing of officials
- deliberately violating regulations
- rate filings
- reserves
(one may try to use bribery to file improper rates or inadequate reserves)
(however there is a chance of being caught, which could lead to fines or jail time)
- process for initiating IPO
- process for taking company private
- see how bankruptcy affects other firms (can it cause a runaway affect?)

Employee
- hiring
- layoffs
- wage setting
- poaching (also falls under competitive)
- development of skills


competitive
- predatory pricing
- price fixing
- monopoly
- corporate espionage

hypotheses I would like to test:
- affordability problems for low-income buyers
- can anticompetitive actions really make for a more stable market?
- is it worth it to spend more money on actuaries?
